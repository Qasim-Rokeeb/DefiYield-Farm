# 📄 Solidity Smart Contract Project

This repository contains a Solidity-based smart contract project. It is part of my ongoing work in building decentralized applications and experimenting with Ethereum-compatible blockchain development.

---

## 📌 Overview

* Written in **Solidity**.
* Designed for **EVM-compatible networks** (e.g., Ethereum, Base, Polygon, etc.).
* Project is **not yet verified** on the blockchain explorer — verification will be added in a future update.

---

## ⚙️ Development Details

* **Language:** Solidity `^0.8.x`
* **Frameworks/Tools:** Remix, Hardhat, or Foundry (depending on the project)
* **Target Networks:** Ethereum testnets (e.g., Sepolia, Base Sepolia) or mainnet

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

* Node.js & npm (if using Hardhat/Foundry)
* MetaMask or another Web3 wallet
* Testnet ETH for deployment

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>
```

Install dependencies (if applicable):

```bash
npm install
```

---

## 🛠 Deployment

You can deploy this contract via:

* **Remix** (web-based IDE)
* **Hardhat** (local development environment)
* **Foundry** (fast testing & deployment)

Example (Hardhat):

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

Run tests locally (if provided):

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

---

## 📜 Verification Status

* **Current Status:** ❌ Not Verified
* The contract will be verified in future updates once final deployment is complete.
